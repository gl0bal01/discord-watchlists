## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gl0bal01/discord-watchlists.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   This project requires PHP and the `php-curl` extension. You can install them on a Debian-based system with the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install php php-curl
   ```

3. **Configure the scripts:**

   - Navigate to the `src/config` directory and rename `config.example.php` to `config.php`.
   - Open `config.php` and replace the placeholder webhook URLs with your actual Discord webhook URLs.

## How to get a Discord webhook URL

1. **Open your Discord server and go to "Server Settings" > "Integrations".**
2. **Click on "Webhooks" and then "New Webhook".**
3. **Give your webhook a name and choose the channel you want it to post to.**
4. **Copy the webhook URL and paste it into the `config.php` file.**

## Running the scripts

You can run each script individually from the command line:

```bash
php cve/cve.php
php europol/europol.php
php fbi/fbi.php
php fun/fun.php
php ransomware/ransomware.php
```

You can also set up a cron job to run the scripts automatically at a specified interval. For example, to run the CVE script every hour, you would add the following line to your crontab:

```bash
0 * * * * php /path/to/your/project/cve/cve.php
```
